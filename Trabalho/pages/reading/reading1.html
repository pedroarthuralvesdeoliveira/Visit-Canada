		<p id="texto">Ottawa is a beautiful city. Its main characteristics are: education of the people, freedom of expression and non-discrimination, and, especially, security, because people can walk along the streets, even late at night, without any problem. Ottawa is the capital of Canada, the fourth largest city in the country and the second largest city in Ontario, behind Vancouver, and it's the 14th best city in the world.</p>
