		<p id="texto">There is no list of the best cities in the world to live in that Vancouver does not appear. Facing the Pacific, with mountains, full of beaches and forests, this city on the west coast of Canada is truly wonderful. The Capilano Suspension Bridge Park is one of the top tourist attractions in Vancouver, Canada. The main attraction of the park is a wooden bridge that is almost 140 meters long, at a height of 70 meters on the Capilano River.</p>
