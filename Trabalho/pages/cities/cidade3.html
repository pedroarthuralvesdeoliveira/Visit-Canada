		<h1>Cn Tower</h1>
		<p>The <b>largest</b> city in Canada is Toronto. It has 5.5 million people and is also the fifth <b>largest</b> metropolitan area in North America.</p>
		<p>To admire the city, visit the CN Tower, this tower is over 553 meters high and for a long time it was the <b>tallest</b> tower in the world but nowadays, it loses the podium to Tokyo Sky Tree in Japan.
		The region also has the <b>longest</b> street on the planet, Yonge Street, with 1896 kilometers.</p>
		<p>Those who love to shop will love Toronto. One of its main sights, the Eaton Center, is a shopping mall with more than 230 shops.</p>
		<p>In the summer, don't forget to check out the beaches of the city. The Lake beaches are in the Toronto Islands, which are fifteen minutes by ferry from downtown. It is also worth noting that Toronto takes less than two hours drive from the famous Niagara Falls.</p>
