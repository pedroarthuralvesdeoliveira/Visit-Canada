			<p>Banff National Park: "The Crown of the Continent" is also called the National Park of Peace, a World Heritage Site and a Biosphere Reserve. Waterton National Park trails are ideal for anyone who wants to improve the mountaineering in a special circuit. The favorite attraction is the Crypt Lake which is 17 kilometers long and passes through waterfalls and natural tunnels that go up to 675 meters high.</p>	
			<h1>Lake Louise</h1>
			<p> In the summer, paddling in this sparkling blue water lake (the Crypt Lake), surrounded by the Valley of the Ten Peaks, is one of the most welcoming and surprising experiences when visiting Banff National Park. In the winter, the lake freezes and becomes one of the most elegant skating rinks in Canada.</p>
