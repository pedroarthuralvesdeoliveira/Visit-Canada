		<h1>Niagara Falls</h1>
		<p>Admiring the exuberance of the three most famous waterfalls in the world by catwalks, boats or helicopter would be enough, but the city offers much more than that. Niagara <b>has</b> casinos such as the Fallsview,  which is the most famous of them.
		<p>This destination is pleasant and full of attractions. Planned, in minuscule proportions, to be a themed destination, the city of Niagara welcomes tourists from all over the world, who come to explore the wonders of the famous Clifton Hill. The street <b>has</b> miniatures of various attractions that create a cinematographic climate that takes us away from reality!</p>
		<p>The place offers incredible beauties in the four seasons of the year and it is worth to enjoy each of them. In the summer, you can see the falls melting and in the winter you will find the falls totally frozen. If you love beauty and harmony with nature, you <b>have</b> to visit the Niagara Falls.</p>
